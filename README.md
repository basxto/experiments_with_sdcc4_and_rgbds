# experiments_with_sdcc4_and_rgbds

I made some patches to SDCC4 source code, that fix the generation of rgbds-compatible asm listing.

You need RGBDS 0.4.1 from here: https://github.com/rednex/rgbds/releases

Based on gb-starter-kit by ISSOtm: https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-starter-kit

I appriciate your help and feedback. 

Tony.
